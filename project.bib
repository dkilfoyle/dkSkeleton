  abstract = {The incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy was examined in 1,075
	patients receiving routine CT angiography and CT perfusion brain
	imaging at a single institution. Fifty-two patients had a creatinine
	rise of â‰¥0.5 mg/dL. In four patients (0.37%), the administration
	of IV contrast medium possibly contributed to renal failure. Two
	patients (0.19%) received temporary hemodialysis during hospitalization.
	The incidence of contrast nephropathy in neurovascular patients is
	low.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the radiation dose delivered
	during comprehensive computed tomography (CT) imaging for acute stroke.All
	CT examinations performed over 18 months using our acute stroke protocol
	were included. Protocol includes an unenhanced CT head, CT angiography
	from the arch to vertex, CT perfusion/permeability, and an enhanced
	CT head. All imaging was acquired with a 64-MDCT. Examinations where
	any element of the protocol was repeated or omitted due to mistimed
	injection or patient motion were excluded. Dose-length products (DLP)
	for all components of each examination were obtained from dose reports
	generated at the time of acquisition, separating neck, and head calculations.
	Effective doses for each examination were calculated using the DLP
	and normalized values of effective dose per DLP appropriate for the
	body regions imaged.Ninety-five examinations were included. Mean
	DLP was 6,790.0 mGy x cm. Effective doses ranged from 11.8 to 27.3
	mSv, mean effective dose of 16.4 mSv. Mean effective dose for acquisition
	of the unenhanced head was 2.7 mSv. Largest contribution to effective
	dose was the CTA with a mean effective dose of 5.4 mSv. Mean effective
	dose for the CT perfusion was 4.9 mSv.A comprehensive CT acute stroke
	protocol delivered a mean effective dose of 16.4 mSv, which is approximately
	six times the dose of an unenhanced CT head. These high-dose results
	must be balanced with the benefits of the detailed anatomic and physiologic
	data obtained. Centers should implement aggressive dose reduction
	strategies and freely use MR as a substitute.},
